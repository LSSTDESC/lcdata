======

About
-----

lcdata is a package for manipulating large datasets of astronomical time series. lcdata
is designed to handle very large datasets: it uses a compact internal representation to
be able to keep many light curves in memory at the same time. For datasets that are too
large to fit in memory, it offers the option of reading them from disks in chunks.
lcdata also contains tools to download different publicly available releases of
astronomical time series.
